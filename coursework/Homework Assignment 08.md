Due Date: 11/08/2021 6:00 PM

  

Please check all homework assignments into GitHub according to the steps described in HW05 Exercise 5. You will be required to check in two files:

- A markdown (.md) file for explaining your code

- A SQL (.sql) file that will run without error in PostgreSQL

  

Don't forget to have your folder when you check your work into master.

  

As always, if you experience an error message, write it up and record your work in the [MATH_290_Knowledge_Base](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTduVN-MqKQnQ6DTwRQYigieR1N7aov7YIvcbDXLXQ0/edit?usp=sharing).

  

We will continue exploring the previously downloaded [IMDB database](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).
